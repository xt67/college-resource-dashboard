## 🚀 How Our Project Works (Simple Explanation)

```
User Opens Website → Frontend (React) → Backend (Node.js) → Database → Back to User
```

1. **User visits the website** (localhost:3000)
2. **Website asks backend for data** (like "show me all resources")
3. **Backend gets data from database** (PostgreSQL/SQLite)
4. **Backend sends data back to website**
5. **Website shows the data to user** (nice looking pages)

## 🔧 What Technologies We Used

| What | Technology | Why |
|------|------------|-----|
| Website | React | Easy to build, popular |
| Backend | Node.js | Fast, uses JavaScript |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Stores all our data |
| Design | Material-UI | Makes it look professional |
| Security | JWT | Keeps logins safe |

## 📝 Easy Q&A for Professor

**Q: How does login work?**
A: User enters email/password → Backend checks if correct → Gives them a token → Token lets them use the app

**Q: How do you prevent double booking?**
A: When someone books, we check if that time is already taken → If yes, we say no → If not, we save the booking

**Q: What if database breaks?**
A: We have backup - if PostgreSQL doesn't work, it automatically uses SQLite

**Q: How did you divide the work?**
A: Member 1 did database, Member 2 did website, Member 3 did setup, Member 4 did testing and charts

**Q: How do you run this project?**
A: 
1. Clone from GitHub
2. Install packages (`npm install`)
3. Start backend (`npm run dev`)
4. Start frontend (`npm start`)
5. Open localhost:3000
