## 2. How the Project Works (System Overview)

- **Three-tier architecture:**
  - **Frontend (React.js)**: User interface, runs on port 3000
  - **Backend (Node.js/Express.js)**: API server, runs on port 5000
  - **Database (PostgreSQL/SQLite)**: Data storage, auto-detected
- **Workflow:**
  1. User accesses the web app (frontend)
  2. Frontend sends API requests to backend (RESTful endpoints)
  3. Backend processes requests, interacts with database
  4. Responses sent back to frontend for display
  5. Authentication via JWT tokens, role-based access enforced
- **Key Features:**
  - User authentication (JWT)
  - Resource CRUD (create, read, update, delete)
  - Booking system with conflict detection
  - Admin dashboard for user/resource management
  - Analytics and reporting
  - Mobile responsive design

## 5. Common Professor Questions & Answers

### Q: Who did what in the project?
- See section 1 above for detailed division of work.

### Q: How does the frontend connect to the backend?
- The React frontend sends HTTP requests (using Axios) to the Express backend's RESTful API endpoints. The backend processes these requests, interacts with the database, and returns JSON responses to the frontend.

### Q: How is authentication handled?
- Users log in with email/password. The backend verifies credentials and issues a JWT token. The frontend stores this token and includes it in the Authorization header for protected API requests. The backend checks the token and enforces role-based access.

### Q: What happens if PostgreSQL is not available?
- The backend automatically falls back to SQLite for development, ensuring the app always runs.

### Q: How is booking conflict prevented?
- The backend checks for overlapping bookings for the same resource before confirming a new booking. If a conflict is detected, the booking is rejected.

### Q: How is the project secured?
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt, JWT tokens are used for authentication, role-based access is enforced, rate limiting is applied, and environment variables are used for secrets.

### Q: How did you test the project?
- Automated tests (Jest, Supertest) for backend, manual and UI tests for frontend, and test data for demo scenarios.

### Q: How is the project documented?
- Comprehensive README, API documentation, user guide, and project report are included in the repository.

### Q: What are the future enhancements?
- Email notifications, calendar integration, mobile app, payment integration, advanced analytics, and scalability improvements.
